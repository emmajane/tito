# Key Take-Aways

A list of things which were noteworthy to me, because they weren't already
things which I perceived to be obvious. I.e. this is not a summary of 
the book.

- Great explainers picture themselves in the listener's shoes.
- People who care about ideas are more motivated to learn them.
- Think about "process" but share "product".
- Explanation provides scaffolding that supports adaptive behaviour.
- Inside the bubble of understanding, you need to use domain specific language
  to communicate effectively.
- Outside the bubble of understanding you need people to FEEL smart.
- What goes into packaging an explanation:
  - Agreement: we can all agree that X.
  - Context: a foundation for the explanation and why it matters to you.
  - Story: Show a person who experienced a pain, made a change, and now doesn't.
  - Connections: Analogies and metaphors which connect the story to the new
    principles you are introducing.
  - Descriptions: Direct communications which focus on "how", not "why".
  - Conclusions: A summary of what was learned.
- Calculate the length of your script by getting the number of words in a
  transcript, and the total length of the video. e.g. 4 minutes = 500-600 words
  for the book's author
- Building confidence in the audience is the key to moving them forward with the
  ideas. Moving from "why" to "how".
