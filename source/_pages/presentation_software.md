There's no one "right answer" on which software you should use to deliver your presentation. In fact, maybe you don't even need to use presentation software at all! Below are a few of my favourite "things you never knew about your software" tips and tricks.

## reveal.js

Available on: any OS that can run a local web server (presentation delivered through a browser); if you have any internet connection, you can also upload your slides and deliver them from the web.

- Presentation notes are not reliable. Sometimes they freeze and get out of sync. Generally this doesn't happen, but I would not yet trust it enough to give very high pressure presentations where I *needed* to have the speaker notes available to me.

## Keynote

Available on: OS X. Notes as of version 6.5.3.

- The "outline" view will accept a paste of text from an outside application. This means you can write an outline in Markdown or OmniOutliner or whatever, and then paste this into the "outline" view to create a series of slides.
- Any customisations you add to your presenter display are ONLY available from your computer. There does not seem to be a way to export this information, so if you are not presenting on your computer, you will not have the presenter display apply your settings.
- If you paste a 4:3 slide into a 16:9 presentation, the software will crash if you try to use the arrow keys to run the presentation (bug has been reported to Apple).

When presenting, if your display isnâ€™t arranged correctly then Keynote and OS X have a couple of keyboard shortcuts that can make life easier:

- _Cmd + Brightness (F1)_ toggles display mirroring on and off.
- _Alt + Brightness (F1)_ brings up Display Preferences and holding _Alt_ shows the _Detect Displays_ button.

- If the presenter notes and main slide displays are the wrong way around _X_ will swap them.
- If you want to hide your slides for any reason _W_ will blank the main display with white, and _B_ will do the same in black.


## LibreOffice

Available on: Linux, OS X, Windows. Notes as of version 4.2.8.2.

- Presentations are a package of zipped files. If you unzip the files, you can easily retrieve asset images from the presentation without having to screenshot the slide.
